## Introduction

This is the simulator that used for practicing certain phases in the Final Fantasy XIV Dragonsong's Reprise Ultimate. It will try to simulate Boss Timeline, Boss Actions, AOE damages, and actors' behaviors (aside from the player). It is expected to help the player to be familiar with mechnism before they can reach the phase in the real game.
